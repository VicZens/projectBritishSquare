1. Assignment Feedback
----------------------
a) What did you learn by doing this assignment?

I learned that its not easy to code anything all in one sitting.
Some things were done last minute, such as the commenting and the
debugging for compatibility, but most things, such as printing
the board and printing the output, was done beforehand. It was a
bit stressful near the end.


----------------------
b) What was easy about this assignment?

Nothing was really easy about this assignment and nothing was
really hard about this assignment. I did go on a coding spree
a few times but I would not say that it was easy. It was just
knowing what to do at that point in time that made the code 
work smoothly.


----------------------
c) What was harder than you originally thought?

Nothing was really harder than what I originally thought. Maybe
creating and printing the array since it had to look exactly like
what was given to use, but besides that they were all within
expectations.


----------------------
d) What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

I think this assignment was good. We had a lot of freedom to do
it the way we pleased and in the end was a challenging but
fulfilling project to do. Maybe if it was a more modern game
so that strategy guides are available for the hard AI, but that
might just be something we have to think about ourselves, which
is nice.


----------------------
e) What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

It would’ve been better if the output was customizable, but
it would’ve been much harder to grade and would take the grader
a much longer time. But although the project did give freedom,
there were parts of it that would be restricting.


----------------------
f) What other issues would you like to discuss?

Nothing else.
